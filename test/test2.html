                    One of Spider-Man's most crucial abilities is his spider-sense, a precognitive ability that warns him of immediate danger. This sixth sense manifests as a tingling sensation at the base of his skull, alerting him to threats before they become apparent. It helps him dodge bullets, avoid sneak attacks, and even sense when someone is lying to him. This ability has saved his life countless times.

                    The Daily Bugle is New York's most prominent newspaper, run by the cantankerous J. Jonah Jameson. Despite Spider-Man's heroic deeds, Jameson has made it his personal mission to paint the web-slinger as a menace to society. His relentless editorials and sensational headlines have shaped public opinion about Spider-Man, often making the hero's job more difficult. Peter Parker works as a freelance photographer for the Bugle, selling photos of himself as Spider-Man to make ends meet.
